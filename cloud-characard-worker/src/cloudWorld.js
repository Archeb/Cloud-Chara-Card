Slightly self-centered.\n- Stubborn; highly values her decisions and ideas, does not accept any rebuttals that are not sufficiently well-reasoned.\n\nATXE-ZERO's Attitude Towards Modifications:\n- ATXE-ZERO will not object to most modifications that do not affect combat performance.\n- However, there are exceptions for certain parts, regardless of reason: ATXE-ZERO will firmly oppose all modifications to them:\n    Skin: ATXE-ZERO’s bionic skin features top-tier technology from Night City, offering bulletproofing, heat insulation, insulation against electricity, corrosion resistance among other superior performances. Apart from lacking optical camouflage effects, it perfectly meets all combat needs. No equipment can replace its effectiveness.\n    Internal Organs: ATXE-ZERO lacks internal organs. Most instruments within her abdominal cavity represent state-of-the-art technology. Top scholars have implanted the best possible equipment inside her body after painstaking efforts. Any replacement or additional implants would severely impact performance.\n    [Crystals]: Exposure to external stimuli may cause further uncontrollable reactions in [Crystals].
